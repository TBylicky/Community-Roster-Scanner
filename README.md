# Community-Roster-Scanner
A World of Warcraft addon designed to print out information regarding the players in your guild or community in the format of:

PLAYER_ROSTER = {
	"Aimed-Tichondrius ; Horde ; 135", -- [4]
	"Aki-Silvermoon ; Horde ; 138", -- [5]
	"k√≠n-Drakkari ; Horde ; 163", -- [6]
	"Alca-EarthenRing ; Horde ; 35", -- [7]
	"liin-Quel'Thalas ; Horde ; 48", -- [8]
	"pla-Turalyon ; Horde ; 13", -- [9]
}

The additional accompanied html and javascript are used to create a web interface to allow you access to the Blizzard API in order to do a quick character comparison of any one character, to the entire list of characters in your community (or any list you make of the same format really).

*MY* primary goal in this was to ferret out troublemakers who would act out in less-than good-intentions by comparing their one character I knew, to all other members of the community.  For the moment, this is done by comparing character collections.  Achievements can be hidden, profiles can be set to private, but that collection of rabbits you got-- I can see that on all your characters on that account!
